# Week 9

*As always: make a copy of this repository to commit changes to*

## Class Outline

### Midterm submission

There are two ways to submit the midterm:

- Make a PR as normal against the class midterm repo. If you have done your work in another folder, you can still fork the midterm repo, and copy/paste all the files/folders into the new forked repo before making the PR.

- Send Nathan and I a link to your repo. This could be a link to the github repo, or a link to the live map. I will talk about this in class today. But you can use github pages to publish the map for you, as per this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) The advantage of this approach is that you could make it look more professional if you plan to use this for a portfolio. It would not be so clearly a midterm project that had a starting template for an assignment. IE: https://github.com/rossbernet/philadelphia-squares


### Guest speaker:

Mapbox's [Bob Lannon](https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/bob-lannon/) will walk us through examples using [Mapbox gl js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/).


### Remainder of the course direction discussion
